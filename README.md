#Neural networks in Java.
This repository was made with the objective to solve problems about
neural networks, like Character Recognition, Logic Gates problem solving, etc.

The exercises solved are in Neural Network Programming with Java [1], the
link to see this book is above the documentation.

I want to apply the power of Artificial Intelligence with regulatedlike
Environment to solve problems that are involved in areas like 
image recognition, object recognition, deep learning, big data,
data mining and machine learning.

## What is an artificial neural network
> Is the set of artificial neurons connected to each other, and the ANNs --Artificial Neural Networks inspired in biological neural networks that are joined with the nervous system.

## Project structure

An Artificial Neural Network contains the following elements:


1. Neurons: Is a part of ANN and is located into one layer, with different input and output signals.
2. Weights: Are part of a input/output signal of a neural network, it's a scalar value that contains 
3. Layers: Contain neurons encapsulated, are used like containers to get and set new Neurons.

Inherited files throw packages:

1. Neuron: In this class is defined the Neuron type/class.
2. Layer: In this class is defined the Layer base to extends into other Input and Output Layers.
3. InputLayer: In this class is defined the InputLayer. 
4. OutputLayer: In this class is defined the OutputLayer, that contains the listOfNeurons in the output layer.
5. HiddenLayer: In this class is defined the HiddenLayer, this layer specially receives an ArrayList of layers and it refactor the listOfHidenLayer to add a new HiddenLayer into the list.
6. NeuralNet: In this class is defined the ANN --Artificial Neural Network, this class contains the 
7. NeuralNetworkTest:
